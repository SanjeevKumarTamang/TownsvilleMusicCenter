        Choir director Beat Lehmann was born in Switzerland where he first became involved in choir music by participating in classical productions
        like Handel's Messiah, Mozart's Mass in C minor etc. A study year abroad gave him the opportunity to sing with the Pontardullais Welsh Male
        Choir. After completing an M.A. in Social Anthropology he concentrated on his other passion, dance, directing a Modern Dance Company for
        several years. In 1986, Beat migrated to Australia where he completed a Ph.D. in Linguistics and involved himself in choir music again.
        For 12 years he conducted AkaBella, a well-known world music choir from Bellingen, NSW. AkaBella participated in major festivals like the
        National Folk Festival in Canberra, the Bellingen Global Carnival and theWoodford Folk Festival where they featured in the ABC documentary
        ÃƒÂ¬Festival on Fire and launched their first CD 'Mosaic'. Beat moved to Magnetic Island in 2003 and has established a similarly successful
        world music choir for the Townsville area. Beat's choirs focus on the rich musical heritage of cultures around the globe. A South African
        party song, a Hungarian love triangle, a Mexican lullaby, a French version of 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight' to delve into the incredible variety
        and depth of a cappella world music and the cultures it represents, is not only fun, but a very enriching and uplifting experience.

        Aquapella won the ABC Choir of the Year competition for Queensland in 2006.
