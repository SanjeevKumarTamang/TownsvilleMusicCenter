    <h2>PMI</h2>
    <p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
    <p><strong>Pluses: </strong> Being good team player is one of the key factor for success. During this project, we got an
        opporunity to know new friends and learnt how to adapt and cooperate in completely new environment. It helped to
        increase our communication skill. We came to realize that group knowledge is always greater than individual's kowledge.
        Division of works and making target to acomplish the target within time frame helped us much to gain idea about project
        management skills.Some of the plus points of our sites are..</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Responsive</li>
            <li>User friendly</li>
            <li>Proper use of images</li>
            <li>Proper direcory setup for corresponding materials</li>
        </ul>
    <p><strong>Minuses: </strong> Groups of individuals sitting together to find a solution, sometimes creates debates.
    Same situations were created sometime among us.When one would come with new idea, other would not find it satisfactory.
        Beside than this difficulty in managing time to make group discussion made us delayed to
        complete  the project than given target frame. Some of the minus points of our sites are</p>
    <ul>
        <li>More numbers of images could be used to mak esite more attractive.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Interesting: </strong> While developing the website we sometimes had a feeling of competition which indeed resulted to
    good product rather than misunderstanding. When one of us shared something new like  templates, new button style or layout, others always
    argued and tried to find better than that. This feel of competetion actually made us to do more research and find better solution
